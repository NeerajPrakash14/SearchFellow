# SearchFellow
A 'Search' service for scale

## Here, the search service is being built to return the 'Top N most searched' items/products from a domain wherever the search is applicable.

(Currently, testing for 5 million items)


The service is built using Trie and Redis Sorted sets
- Trie - data structure used for faster searching
- Redis Sorted sets - data structure used for faster access to ordered data
